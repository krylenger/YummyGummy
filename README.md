This project was written during Framework module of kottans Frontend course.

Each student had his unique app, theme of the app was chosen and written by the individual student.

At first we wrote the MVP app without any framework, just using function calls and returning template strings from them to render our app. The app state was located in the window storage.

After that, step by step, we've started to add some "custom framework" features to make our life easier.

Such as: we split our single js file into component folders, added JSX to it, implemented custom state and useEffect hooks, added context.

Only by the end of the module we've moved our projects from custom framework to React.

This helped us a lot to understand the value of the framework and which problems it helps us to solve.
